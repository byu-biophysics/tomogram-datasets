# tomogram_datasets

Welcome to the documentation for the `tomogram_datasets` module. This module simplifies tasks dealing with tomograms and their respective annotations. In particular, it is useful in the BYU Biophysics Group as a tool to easily access tomograms on BYU's supercomputer (see [Supercomputer utils](/supercomputer_utils/)).
