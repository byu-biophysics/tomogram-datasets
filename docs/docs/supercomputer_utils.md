# Supercomputer Utils

The functions described here tend to be useful when navigating the labyrinth that is our supercomputer to find tomograms and (for now) their associated flagellar motor annotations. `get_fm_tomogram_set` is particularly useful. It parses the supercomputer for the tomograms and annotations that essentially make up the dataset for the Kaggle competition we are launching.
